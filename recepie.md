steps to be followed



1.Use fresh ingredients – onions, ginger, garlic, green chilies, cilantro, mint and curry leaves.
2.Allow the meat to marinate overnight in the refrigerator so that all the flavors and spices will get into the meat.
Shallow fry the marinated chicken/meat before combining with the onion masala.
3.When you cook the rice: add whole cardamoms, cloves, cinnamon, bay leaves, cumin seeds, ghee along with the rice and water.
4.If you’re not frying the chicken or meat: cook the meat along with water, drain the stock from the cooked meat and cook the rice in the meat stock. This way, the rice will taste absolutely delicious. Recipe
5.Don’t forget to Dum the biryani (final slow cooking after layering the rice and meat masala). Cover the biryani pot with aluminum foil and close with a lid, place over low heat and cook for 15 minutes.
6.Use homemade fresh fried onions (fry the onions in oil till golden brown). Store-bought fried onions lack flavour, aroma and taste.
7.Sprinkle fresh mint leaves over the rice layers, the aroma of mint leaves makes the biryani taste a whole lot better (my favorite step).
8.To enhance the taste further, sprinkle saffron (2 pinches) soaked in 3 tbsp milk or water over the rice while layering.
9.Use good quality Basmati rice, pure Coconut oil while shallow frying the chicken and pure ghee while cooking the meat masala- these will make biryani taste delish.
